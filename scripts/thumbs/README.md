# Copying 20 thumb drives at once

In the general spirit of "automate all the things!", what's in here is a couple of 
scripts designed to help us write all of the contents of this repository to
the thumb drives we handed out.

## Basic howto

1. sudo mount-drives.sh
2. stuff-drives.sh
3. sudo unmount-drives.sh

Use the force, read the source! :)
